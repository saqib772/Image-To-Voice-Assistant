# Image-To-Voice-Assistant

# To create a chatbot that can translate the content from images to voice using Python.
First, install the necessary libraries:
!pip install pytesseract
!pip install Pillow
!pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
!pip install gTTS


Note that the code that you have created an endpoint /translate-image on your server that takes an image file and a target language as input, and returns the translated text and a URL to the speech file. You will need to implement this endpoint using the Python code provided earlier.

Also note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to fit your specific use case.
